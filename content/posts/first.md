Hello, I am **kibonoko**.

I plan to write about things occasionally.

You can read that stuff here. 

Here are some things I plan to write about.

# Japan

I moved to Japan in 2013. I am a permanent resident of Japan.

# Bitcoin

Bitcoin is money. It is the very best form of money. I encourage everyone
to own and use Bitcoin.

# Family

I have a wife, a son and daughter. 

# Programming

I work as a software engineer. I enjoy programming.
